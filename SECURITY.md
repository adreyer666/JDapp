# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This is active early stage development, there are plenty of issues.
If you want something fixed, please use the issue tracker on github to report (ideally with a patch provided).
Nothing is currently being supported with security updates.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 0.5   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please send private message if you want to report a vulnerability.

Once acknowledged, you can expect to get updates once a week on any reported vulnerability (if I am not on holiday).
If the vulnerability is accepted it will hopefully be fixed in the following week (or at least the next release). 
If declined, please send me an exploit and possible fix patches and I might reconsider...
